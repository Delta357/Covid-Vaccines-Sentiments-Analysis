The vaccine approved this week by Canada also seemed like if not an armistice, a turning point. The first shipment of the vaccine created by the American company Pfizer and a German firm, BioNTech, is likely to be still in transit this weekend, and the first inoculations could come as early as Tuesday.

       "  'Six wooden Brillo boxes in the Andy Warhol collection at a Swedish museum are fakes that were made in 1990, three years after Warhol died, The Associated Press reported yesterday. Warhol created the original reproductions of Brillo soap pad cartons as part of a 1964 exhibition of art resembling supermarket products. (At right is a version of the 1964 original.) The museum, Moderna Museet in Stockholm, said it had investigated the six Brillo boxes, donated in 1995 by its former director, Pontus Hulten, after a Swedish newspaper claimed that they were copies. In a letter to the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York, the museum director, Lars Nittve, confirmed the claims. “These boxes are not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol Brillo boxes,” Mr. Nittve wrote. The Swedish paper Expressen reported in June that Mr. Hulten, who was director of the museum in the 1960s and the Georges Pompidou Center in Paris in the 1970s and 1980s, had Swedish carpenters build 105 copies of the box for an exhibition in Russia in 1990.

The museum, Moderna Museet in Stockholm, said it had investigated the six Brillo boxes, donated in 1995 by its former director, Pontus Hulten, after a Swedish newspaper claimed that they were copies. In a letter to the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York, the museum director, Lars Nittve, confirmed the claims. “These boxes are not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol Brillo boxes,” Mr. Nittve wrote. The Swedish paper Expressen reported in June that Mr. Hulten, who was director of the museum in the 1960s and the Georges Pompidou Center in Paris in the 1970s and 1980s, had Swedish carpenters build 105 copies of the box for an exhibition in Russia in 1990.
